sending an email along with the Intruder images so that the owner will take quick action and hence any mishappening will be avoided.

## Project Outcomes
- Here Deep Learning, Open CV and Computer Vision is used as a Technology.
- Face_recognition Python Module has been used for recognising the face.
- It is a dlibâ€™s state-of-the-art face recognition module built with deep learning backend.
- The Model gives the Accuracy of Approx 96% in Detecting Intruders.
